# Fabulous Styleboard

The **Fabulous Styleboard** is a comprehensive HTML document with a built-in stylesheet switcher, allowing you to preview the effects of different stylesheets on a wide range of HTML elements.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Add a `<link>` element to the `<head>` section of index.html using the following template:

```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/stylesheet.css" data-name="Display Name">
```
The `data-name` attribute is required to ensure the stylesheet switcher functions properly. You can specify which stylesheets are active on page load by adding the `disabled` attribute to those you do not want enabled by default.
